# classpath.vim

This plugin sets the `'path'` for JVM languages to match the class path of
your current Java project.  This lets commands like `:find` and `gf` work as
designed.  I originally wrote it for Clojure, but I see no reason why it
wouldn't be handy for other languages as well.

Currently, [Maven][] and [Leiningen][] are supported, with a fallback to
`$CLASSPATH` if neither applies.  [Open an issue][GitHub issues] if you have
ideas for supporting another project management system.

Included is a `:Java` command, which executes `java` (or `$JAVA_CMD`) with the
current buffer's `'path'` as the class path.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-classpath.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help classpath`.
